        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is <strong>Okoro Patrick Chidera,</strong>
          <em>
            i am an igbo boy, i hail from ebonyi state of ohaozara local
            government. I am the fourth of the six children given birth in my
            family,I was born into a comfortable home, where my mother sells
            food and my late father sells machine spare parts. I was given birth
            in ikom local government area of cross river state, where i attended
            holy family primary school and obtained my first school leaving
            certificate. And relocated to asaba,delta state where i attended
            <mark>Honour roll international schools</mark> where i was given the
            senior prefect of the prestigious school. I was ten years old when i
            lost dad, that was really difficult for my family things became
            worst i had to drop from school due,to lack of funds. I started
            begging people around me just to feed things went sour for me i had
            to relocate to asaba to find greener pastures which i later found by
            the grace of God. in my family. We have two boys and four girls i
            have an elder brother who caters for me and my family he was the one
            who brought the idea of programming when i finished high school at
            first i said no because i thought programming was too difficult, so
            he persisted he got me a laptop to code so i started watching
            youtube tutorials, and really got fascinated about programming in
            general. I started learning amazing stuffs,building projects but i
            wasn't satisfied so i enrolled in
            <b
              >altschoolafrica and alx africa!!! to
              <em>brush of my coding skills</em> i hope this would be an
              audacious journey cause i want to really build projects.</b

          from scratch using <mark><b>HTML and CSS</b></mark> currently i
          haven't built any project of mine because i am a lazy engineer but
